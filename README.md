# Steps to get started
  - run `npm install` to install dependencies
  - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
  - create a variable in the .env file called `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` and set it to your OpenAI API key
  - run `npm build` to build the project
  - run `npm start` to start the project

The project will then be available at `localhost:3000`
